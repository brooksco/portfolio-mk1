			<h3 class="clean-subheader">Grinnell Localfoods Coop</h3>
			<p>
				From Fall 2012 through Spring 2013 I was the user interaction designer on a project to rebuild the Grinnell Local Foods Cooperative's website. We started from scratch using Ruby on Rails. Of prime concern was the ability for users to easily view and purchase products, for producers to be able to simply manage their inventory, and for coordinators to alter aspects of the site and notify users. My purview included buckets of HTML, CSS3, LESS, and Twitter Bootstrap, and periodically meeting with stakeholders to discus issues of usability. I also took charge of making the site mobile friendly, and of cross-browser/platform testing.

			<p>
				It's all currently being prepped for deployment, but you can visit the shakey and oft-restarted development server temporarily <a href="http://fulkerson.cs.grinnell.edu">here</a>.

			<p>
				Built on Ruby on Rails, and relying on Inuit.css for a mobile-friendly and responsive grid system, this site is meant to be a single page of clean me-centric content. Jquery and Javascript and a little SASS magic are all at play.

				Change is constant.

			<p>
				My current project is to remake the website of <a href="http://rays.org">Renton Area Youth & Family Services</a>. Their old site is dated in feel and lacking in the kinds of information that would make clear the services they provide, and the good they do for the community. I'll be interviewing staff and clients and taking pictures for the ultimate goal of a website that better matches their mission, and allows them to update the content much easier (using WordPress as a CMS).

					I think photography is wonderful. The process of thinking about how to represent a moment in time or a place, and how that representation will be interpreted is something I have never grown tired of. For the last 3 and half years I've worked at the Grinnell College Darkroom, and managed it for the last 2. I've photographed for all kinds of events, and generally just like going wherever with a camera and an open attitude.

					I have extensive experience with:
					<ul>
						<li>Digital cameras & equipment</li>
						<li>Film developing & enlarging</li>
						<li>Flashes & basic lighting</li>
						<li>Adobe Photoshop</li>
						<li>Adobe Lightroom</li>
						<li>Flickr & 500px</li>
					</ul>

					If you want to see what I've done lately, I update my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/pandadumpster">Flickr</a> regularly.
