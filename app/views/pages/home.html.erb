				I'm originally from Seattle, WA. I'm currently set to graduate this May from Grinnell College with a degree in General Science: Computer Science. I was the graphics editor for my high school newspaper, and the manager of our college darkroom. My interests have always been a bit all over the place, but I've always loved <em>creating</em> things and have never been temporally far from an art project. This past year I've been the interaction designer for a Ruby on Rails web app for the Grinnell Localfoods Coop.
